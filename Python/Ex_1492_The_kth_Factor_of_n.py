"""
You are given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined
 as an integer i where n % i == 0.

Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth
factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.



Example 1:

Input: n = 12, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.
Example 2:

Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 7], the 2nd factor is 7.
Example 3:

Input: n = 4, k = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4], there is only 3 factors. We should return -1.


Constraints:

1 <= k <= n <= 1000
